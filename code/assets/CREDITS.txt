The earth image (earth.png) is originally from the JPL (Jet Propulsion
Laboratory) "Looking at Earth: From 100 miles to 100 million miles" gallery:

The images are released under the "JPL Image Use Policiy", which permits use
of the images wor any purpose without prior permission (subject to special
cases listed on the website). See

for further information.

The image has been edited slightly, by adding an alpha mask around the earth
and has then been scaled to a lower resolution, appropriate for the use in the
coursework.
